genetic-algorithms
==================

A (very) basic genetic algorithm engine written in F#. Inspired and based upon [this blog post](http://www.theprojectspot.com/tutorial-post/creating-a-genetic-algorithm-for-beginners/3).

The initial version of the engine is very basic and the example algorithm demonstrates evolving a population of strings towards a target string. Very, very simple. I will add 
more complex examples as I get to grips with the finer points of fitness calculations and crossover/mutation.
